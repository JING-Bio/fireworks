# Fireworks
A genome-wide, hierarchical visualisation of Reactome pathways in a space-filling graph.

The aim of this project is to offer users an intuitive overview of dataset analysis results in the context of the Reactome hierarchical pathway structure, allowing both a quick “first glance” and rapid zooming in on interesting results. 

## Server
The Server folder contains a Java project which contains the layout algorithm and the intermediate graph file creator tools.

## Widget
